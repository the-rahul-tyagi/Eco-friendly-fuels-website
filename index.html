<h3> What are eco friendly fuels ?</h3><br>
<p></p><br>

        <section id="conservation">
            <h2>Understanding eco friendly fuels</h2><br>
            <p>Eco-friendly fuels, also known as renewable fuels or alternative fuels, are types of fuel that are derived from renewable or sustainable sources and produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. These fuels are considered eco-friendly because they contribute less to climate change and have lower environmental impacts. </p>
            <p></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Biofuels: </strong> Made from renewable resources like plants and animal waste, releasing less carbon dioxide than fossil fuels.</li>
                <li><strong>Natural gas: </strong>Although a fossil fuel, it burns cleaner than options like coal, emitting less greenhouse gases.</li>
                <li><strong>Hydrogen: </strong> When produced from renewable energy sources like solar or wind, hydrogen fuel cells can generate electricity with only water vapor as a byproduct.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Importance of eco fuels</h2><br>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions: </strong>Eco fuels are derived from renewable resources such as plants, algae, or organic waste, which absorb carbon dioxide during their growth. When these fuels are burned, they release carbon dioxide, but the net emissions are much lower compared to fossil fuels because the carbon emitted was recently removed from the atmosphere during the feedstock's growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy Security: </strong>By diversifying energy sources away from finite fossil fuels, eco fuels contribute to energy security. Countries can reduce their dependence on imported oil and gas by investing in domestic biofuel production, thereby enhancing energy independence.</li>
                <li><strong>Mitigation of Climate Change: </strong>Given their lower carbon footprint compared to fossil fuels, eco fuels are a valuable tool in mitigating climate change. They help reduce the overall concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, thereby slowing down the rate of global warming.</li>
                <li><strong>Waste Reduction and Recycling: </strong>Some eco fuels are produced from organic waste materials such as food scraps, agricultural residues, and municipal solid waste. By converting these wastes into valuable energy sources, eco fuels contribute to waste reduction, landfill diversion, and resource recycling.</li>
            </ul>

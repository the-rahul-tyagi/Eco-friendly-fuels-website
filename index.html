<h3> What are ecofriendly fuels ?</h3><br>
<p></p><br>

        <section id="conservation">
            <h2>Understanding eco friendly fuels</h2><br>
            <p>Eco-friendly fuels, also known as renewable fuels or alternative fuels, are types of fuel that are derived from renewable or sustainable sources and produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. These fuels are considered eco-friendly because they contribute less to climate change and have lower environmental impacts. </p>
            <p></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Biofuels: </strong> Made from renewable resources like plants and animal waste, releasing less carbon dioxide than fossil fuels</li>
                <li><strong>Natural gas: </strong>Although a fossil fuel, it burns cleaner than options like coal, emitting less greenhouse gases </li>
                <li><strong>Hydrogen: </strong> When produced from renewable energy sources like solar or wind, hydrogen fuel cells can generate electricity with only water vapor as a byproduct </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Importance of eco fuels</h2><br>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions:</strong>Eco fuels are derived from renewable resources such as plants, algae, or organic waste, which absorb carbon dioxide during their growth. When these fuels are burned, they release carbon dioxide, but the net emissions are much lower compared to fossil fuels because the carbon emitted was recently removed from the atmosphere during the feedstock's growth </li>
                <li><strong>Energy Security:</strong>By diversifying energy sources away from finite fossil fuels, eco fuels contribute to energy security. Countries can reduce their dependence on imported oil and gas by investing in domestic biofuel production, thereby enhancing energy independence.</li>
                <li><strong>Mitigation of Climate Change:</strong>Given their lower carbon footprint compared to fossil fuels, eco fuels are a valuable tool in mitigating climate change. They help reduce the overall concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, thereby slowing down the rate of global warming</li>
                <li><strong>Waste Reduction and Recycling:</strong>Some eco fuels are produced from organic waste materials such as food scraps, agricultural residues, and municipal solid waste. By converting these wastes into valuable energy sources, eco fuels contribute to waste reduction, landfill diversion, and resource recycling</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <h2>Risk drivers</h2><br>
            <p>Risk is influenced by the decisions we make. From climate change to poor urban planning, it is critical to understand and address risk drivers to curb disaster risk</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate change drives disaster risk:</strong>Climate change can increase disaster risk in a variety of ways - by altering the frequency and intensity of hazard events, affecting vulnerability to hazards, and changing exposure patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental degradation:</strong> Environmental degradation is both a driver and consequence of disasters, reducing the capacity of the environment to meet social and ecological needs.</li>
                <li><strong> Globalized economic development:</strong> Globalized economic development has resulted in increased polarization between the rich and poor on a global scale. This has increased vulnerability to disasters in some cases, whilst increasing exposure to hazards in others as more (and often more valuable) assets are developed in hazard-prone areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Weak governance:</strong> Weak governance zones are investment environments in which public sector actors are unable or unwilling to assume their roles and responsibilities in protecting rights, providing basic services, public services, and ensuring that public sector management is efficient and effective. These “government failures” lead to broader failures in political, economic and civic institutions that are referred to as weak governance.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Key concepts</h2><br>
            <p>From deterministic and probabilistic risk to intensive and extensive risk, explore key concepts in disaster risk reduction.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong> Anticipatory action:</strong>Anticipatory action allows humanitarians and affected communities to make informed decisions ahead of a humanitarian crisis – saving time and money; preventing displacement, disease, loss of livelihood; and preserving the dignity of those affected.</li>
                <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> Capacity refers to all the strengths, attributes and resources available within a community, organization or society to manage and reduce disaster risks and strengthen resilience.</li>
                <li><strong> Intensive and extensive risk:</strong> Extensive risk is used to describe the risk associated with low-severity, high-frequency events, mainly but not exclusively associated with highly localized hazards. Intensive risk is used to describe the risk associated to high-severity, mid to low-frequency events, mainly associated with major hazards.</li>
                <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> In the context of disaster risk, the ability of a system, community or society exposed to hazards to resist, absorb, accommodate, adapt to, transform and recover from the effects of a hazard in a timely and efficient manner, including the preservation and restoration of its essential basic structures and functions through risk management</li>
